👋 Hi, I’m @Jy4058350　。　I'm a newbie who just recently started programming, and I'm new to github, so please help me out.

👀 I’m interested in ... animation. There are many websites in the world that implement wonderful animations, and I enjoy looking at them.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...JavaScriptw. I am aware that I need to learn a lot, but I don't know which one to start from, so I started learning from JS.
